## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
	- These service (SOA) perform a particular business function and self contained. By faciliting communication and interaction between different software systems, it also allow collaboration to achieve common goals.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	* Service reusability - To minimized the redundancy and develop efforts when a service is built, because it can be used in a different scenario and applications.

	* Abstraction - This service in SOA hide the complexity of their implementation details, providing a simplied interface for interaction.

	* Composability - Services big problems are divided into smaller ones.
	
	* Loose Coupling
	* Autonomy 
	* Standardized Service Contracts
	* Statelessness
	* Discoverability
	
	* Interoperability
	

3. Define Microservices.
	- Microservices is design to separates a single application into smaller and more manageable components with the goal of improving flexibility and ease of development and maintenance.


4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	* Imporved Maintenance - With this indepent services, maintenance and updates can be performed without affecting the entire system.


5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.

* Similarities 

Service-Oriented - Both SOA and Microcervices are architecture style that emphasize a service-oriented approach. They can down systems into modular, independently deployment services.

* Differences  
* Technology Stacks

SOA - Allows for a more standardized technology stack across services. There's often a common set of protocols and standards.
		 
Microservices - is different services can use in a different programming language, frameworks and communication protocols.

* Data Management

SOA - is often uses a shared data model and centralized database.

Microservices - have their own databases and emphasis is on decentralized database. Each microservices owns and manage its data.
